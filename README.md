## Future Releases
Our tool now supports a multi-cloud environment, seamlessly operating across AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This broad support ensures maximum flexibility, allowing users to integrate the tool into their preferred cloud infrastructure with ease.

But we‚Äôre just getting started.

In upcoming releases, we plan to introduce new cloud-native architectures and additional Command and Control (C2) mechanisms across all supported platforms. These enhancements will further strengthen the tool's capabilities for cloud security operations, offering deeper insights and more powerful features for both offensive and defensive use cases.

Stay tuned as we continue to innovate and expand our tool to meet the evolving needs of the cloud security community.
